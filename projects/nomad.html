            With <b>Nomad</b>, I've attempted to create a locally run Python application that visualizes your journeys across
            the world. The application takes in images that you upload, plots them across the map, then draws lines 
            between them that approximate the routes that you've taken with network graphs.
            <br>
            There's currently just a singular metric showing the amount of the Earth that you've seen, and I'm hoping to expand upon
            it with more statistics.
            <br>
            I'm working on turning this into a downloadable app. If you'd like to try it out right now, follow
            the download instructions on its Github page.

            This project has been heavily inspired by my experience reading <i>The Innocents Abroad</i> by Mark Twain.
            <br>
            The humorous, often abstract writings about his adventures around Europe and the Middle East reminded me 
            of how, for a large portion of history, travel was only about self-fulfillment. 
            <br>
            There was no subconscious intention to make a post on social media for validation of your lifestyle. 
            Even moreso, there was no real need to have our images, locations, and thoughts stored in some 
            far off cloud service, where they are treated as sellable data and nothing more.
