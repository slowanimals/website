            This project has been heavily inspired by my experience reading <i>The Innocents Abroad</i> by Mark Twain.
            <br>
            The humorous, often abstract writings about his adventures around Europe and the Middle East reminded me 
            of how, for a large portion of history, travel was only about self-fulfillment. 
            <br>
            There was no subconscious intention to make a post on social media for validation of your lifestyle. 
            Even moreso, there was no real need to have our images, locations, and thoughts stored in some 
            far off cloud service, where they are treated as sellable data and nothing more.
        </p>
        <p>
            With Nomad, I have sought to create a locally run Python app that approximates and draws the paths you
            have taken throughout your journeys, so that you can see the footprint that you've left on the world.
            <br>
            The intention is to be a simple travel log. You only get as much as you put in, and
            I can't help but feel like there is a beauty in that simplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm currently wrapping up work on the frontend of this project. I cannot wait to deliver it by the end
            of November, even if it ends up being just for my personal use.
